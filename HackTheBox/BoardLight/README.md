## Steps taken

These are a rough order of operations for the work done to pwn the BoardLight machine on Hack The Box; A machine labled as an 'easy' box.

- Start the box
- Run a ping check on the device 
- Run an NMAP Scan to see open ports
- Find that 80 and 22 are open

</p>

- Try to get into 22 with blank creds; Access Denied

- Visit 80 and browse around; Found a @board.htb domain in the about me section

</p>

- Add that DNS to the hosts file to see if I can hop over to other domains
- Performed some DNS enumuration with Ffuf â€“ Fuzz Faster U Fool
- Got a hit on crm.board.htb (FUZZ.board.htb)

</p>

- Replace the previous string value in the /etc/hosts file with the new crm.board.htb

- Visit that site to find a Dolibarr CRM app; google default creds and was able to log in. Nothing interesting here though

- Found an exploit online for a reverse shell

- Start a NC listener, ran the exploit after downloading, and was able to get in

- Upgraded my shell session

- Looked around online to see where this web app typically stores credentials

- Found some mysql credentials for someone called dolibarrowner

- Logged into mysql with those credentials and browsed the users table which had a ton of hashed passwords( Can try hashcat here if needed )

- Ran cat /etc/passwd | grep bash to find a root and larissa user. Going to try to ssh back into this machine with the password found in the mysql directory

</p>

- Ran an switch user (su larissa) and put that password in; got into the user directory and grabbed the flag

- To escalate my privleges I was having trouble figuring it out. Got some direction from some blogs that used a SUID explot

- Ran find / -perm /u=s 2>/dev/null to find a potential SUID exploit

- Started an FTP server on my kali machine and brought the file over to the session and executed it to get root

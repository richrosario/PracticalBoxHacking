#  Dev Walkthrough

- Installed the machine from the Google Drive link
- Like always we first start with an **nmap**:
    - Tons of ports open:
        - 80: We find out it’s running Debian/Apache
        - 8080: http
        - 2049: NFS file sharing
- **First we hit 8080**
    - Visiting url’s manually
        - The default page for the IP resolves some Bolt page which shows some folder structures
        - If we add in port 8080 to the url we get a ton of php versioning information ( information disclosure )
    - Running FFUFs to explore directories on both the above urls
        - default
            - http hit
                - Found an interesting directory      
                - There’s a config.yml file that we open to find credentials
        - 8080
            - Found some sort of boltwire website(boltwire is some sort of web dev platform)
                - https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48411
                    - We found an exploits it and just put it into the url, this exploit shows us logged in users
                        - `index.php?p=action.search&action=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
                        - We find a jeanpaul user that’s already logged in
                            - It’s the full name of that jp name we found in 2049 but now we have that password and the full name
                        - In as root
- **Then we hit 2049**
    - We run showmount to find what’s mounted on the target machine
        - sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.0.xxx:/srv/nfs /mnt/dev we mount it to our local machine
            - We find a file and we try to unzip it but it wants a password
                - We run a zip cracker called fcrackzip against a  world list and find the password!
                    - **We find two  files**
                        - todo.txt
                            - found an initial ‘jp’
                        - id_rsa: This can be used to connect via ssh!
                            - we try using that jp we found to ssh but it wants a password!
